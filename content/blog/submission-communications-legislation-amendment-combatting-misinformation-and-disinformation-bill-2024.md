We have significant concerns about the breadth of powers that the Communications Legislation Amendment (Combatting Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2024 proposes to grant the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA)  with limited mechanisms for oversight and accountability.

Mis- and disinformation are undoubtedly serious problems. They ought to be understood in the context of advertising-based business models that focus on the extraction of personal information. The widespread amplification of mis- and disinformation is exacerbated by commercial business models that prioritise engagement and ratings above all else, treating users exclusively as consumers rather than citizens.

We welcome efforts to reduce the spread of mis- and disinformation, but these efforts only target the symptoms of the problem rather than the cause.

Our recent submissions relevant to this inquiry include:

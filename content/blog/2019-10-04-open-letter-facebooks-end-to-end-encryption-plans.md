_Dear Mr. Zuckerberg,_

_OPEN LETTER: FACEBOOK'S END-TO-END SECURITY PLANS_

_The organizations below write today to encourage you, in no uncertain terms, to continue increasing the end-to-end security across Facebook's messaging services._

_We have seen<a href="https://cdt.org/files/2019/10/US-UK-Australia-letter-to-Zuckerberg-10-4-19.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requests from the United States, United Kingdom, and Australian governments</a>asking you to suspend these plans "until [Facebook] can guarantee the added privacy does not reduce public safety". We believe they have this entirely backwards: each day that platforms do not support strong end-to-end security is another day that this data can be breached, mishandled, or otherwise obtained by powerful entities or rogue actors to exploit it._

_Given the remarkable reach of Facebook's messaging services, ensuring default end-to-end security will provide a substantial boon to worldwide communications freedom, to public safety, and to democratic values, and we urge you to proceed with your plans to encrypt messaging through Facebook products and services. We encourage you to resist calls to create so-called "backdoors" or "exceptional access" to the content of users' messages, which will fundamentally weaken encryption and the privacy and security of all users._

_Sincerely,_

AfroLeadership

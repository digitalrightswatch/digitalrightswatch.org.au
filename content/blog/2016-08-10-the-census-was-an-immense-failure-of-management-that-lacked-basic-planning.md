There are calls for an independent inquiry into the failure of the Census last night to restore the faith of Australians in the process.

The census &#8211; delivered by technology company IBM for the Australian Bureau of Statistics &#8211; was shut down last night after what the Government described as an international &#8220;denial of service&#8221; attack.

Non-profit group, Digital Rights Watch, says the Turnbull Government&#8217;s handling of last night&#8217;s online Census demonstrates both a disrespect for personal privacy and a lack of digital literacy.

The group&#8217;s Amy Gray says the ABS didn&#8217;t have the resources or the expertise to run the process effectively.

&#8220;It&#8217;s been quite badly managed from a project management point of view, it hasn&#8217;t had a sector foresight into how Australians interact with digital websites or digital services, and it hasn&#8217;t actually communicated well with Australian people about how to use the service, what their rights are, and also addressing their concerns,&#8221; she says.

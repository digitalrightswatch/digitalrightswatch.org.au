Earlier in the year we hosted an online event to talk about how to uphold human rights when responding to a crisis. Clearly there are plenty of crises in 2020 to respond to, but if we're thinking of using technology as part of the solution, one of the things we need to consider is equitable access, as raised by one of our speakers, Dr. Heron Loban, senior law lecturer and Torres Strait Islander woman. You can watch the recording of the event to hear more of what she has to say on our youtube channel or via our website!

Otherwise, it risks continuing to exclude parts of our community. -Dr Heron Loban"]#digitalrights #humanrights #technology #tech #equity #equality #access #auspol

**Our right to privacy is essential to uphold our democracy, rein in corporate power, and for a safe and fair digital future. It’s time to get privacy right.**

Privacy is a human right, but too many companies and government agencies are getting it wrong.

Australia’s Privacy Act does not adequately protect people’s privacy. It is woefully out of date and unfit for purpose in the modern digital economy. It’s time for the Australian government to bring Australia’s privacy protections into the 21st century.

**Invading privacy is big business**, and companies will try to weaken these reforms. We need to keep up the public pressure and make sure this chance to secure real privacy reform isn’t wasted.

**Join the fight to get privacy reform right.**

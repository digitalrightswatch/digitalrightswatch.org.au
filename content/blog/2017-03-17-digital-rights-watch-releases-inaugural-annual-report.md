After one full year of operations, Digital Rights Watch has released its inaugural annual report.

&#8220;The first twelve months of existence for Digital Rights Watch hasn't come without challenges,&#8221; said Chair Tim Singleton Norton.

&#8220;We have a federal government who continue to implement a national warrantless mass surveillance program, the huge privacy failure of the national Census and countless ongoing issues around the digital rights of Australian citizens.&#8221;

&#8220;We have nonetheless made huge ground in establishing both the need and effectiveness of a new digital rights advocacy organisation.&#8221;

&#8220;Digital Rights Watch's mission is to ensure that Australian citizens are equipped, empowered and enabled to uphold their digital rights. We educate, campaign, lobby and advocate for a digital environment where individuals have the power to maintain their human rights,&#8221; said Mr Singleton Norton.

&#8220;In the past year, we've spoken to the media on countless privacy and digital issues, and written substantive submissions to several key inquiries &#8211; both domestically and internationally. We've engaged with Government, secured partnerships with likeminded organisations, spoken at conferences, held events and joined global campaigns and movements.&#8221;

&#8220;In terms of its governance, Digital Rights Watch is now a national charity, fully registered with the Australian Tax Office and the Australian Charities and Nonprofits Commission.&#8221;

&#8220;Although there is still a huge amount of ground to be made in terms of digital rights in Australia, we remain excited about what the future holds for our organisation,&#8221; he concluded.

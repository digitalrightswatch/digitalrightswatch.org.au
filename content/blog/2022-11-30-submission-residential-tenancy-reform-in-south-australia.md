South Australia&#8217;s _Residential Tenancies Act 1995_ is currently going through a reform process. The review covers a wide range of aspects, including issues related to renters&#8217; digital rights and privacy.

Digital Rights Watch made a submission, focusing on renters&#8217; right to privacy, digital security of renters&#8217; data, and the risk of discrimination or exclusion based on inappropriate use of personal information. 

We urge Consumer and Business Services of SA to consider the ways that digital technologies are changing the nature of renting a home across Australia, and the often-detrimental impacts they are having on renter privacy, security, and the balance of power between landlords and renters. 

In particular, we focus on:

  * the need for robust safeguards and limitations on the use of third-party rental application and property management platforms and apps, including those using automated decision-making systems
  * how digital technologies can create legal grey areas and incentivise rent bidding, 
  * access to information held on residential tenancy databases or &#8216;blacklists&#8217;,
  * standardised application forms, to limit the amount and type of personal information that a real estate agent or landlord can ask for, and,
  * the need for rules to limit the indirect collection of personal information about renters (e.g. through reference checks, social media profiles, or data brokers.

**We also highlight that many of the issues related to the infringement of renter privacy are not just a matter of legality. There is a distinct power imbalance between landlords/real estate agents and renters. Digital technologies claiming to provide marginal improvements to service delivery are exacerbating this power imbalance.**

summary: >
  Social media companies harvest vast amounts of personal data and use it to
  push whatever will keep you engaged, even when that means prioritising
  attention over accuracy, safety, or wellbeing. This can result in mental
  health harms for all users, including increased levels of depression, anxiety
  and body image dissatisfaction. Everyone would benefit from reform that stops
  personal data being used to feed people content that captures attention at the
  expense of their wellbeing.


  However, rather than address the root causes of this harm the Social Media Ban complicates the landscape and creates additional privacy risks for all of us.


  This is your guide to how to navigate this new terrain.

This explainer first considers how the ban affects teens and how under-16s may access support services to supplement the support social media offered them. It then turns to the details of how the ban will be implemented.

# What is  the social media ban?

The social media ban comes into effect on Wednesday December 10, 2025. From this date Australians under 16 will not be able to make new accounts or continue using current accounts on the following ten platforms:

* Facebook
* Instagram
* Kick
* Reddit
* Snapchat
* Threads
* TikTok
* Twitch
* X (formerly Twitter)
* YouTube (YouTube Kids will still be accessible)

Note: the Government is monitoring other applications and also expects app providers to self monitor so this list may expand in the future.

The government has been clear that the onus rests on the social media companies who face fines up to $49.5 million if they fail to take reasonable steps to prevent under-16s accessing their platforms. **No-one using a platform will be fined or in breach of any law.**

# Risks to wellbeing

The Social Media Ban fails to realise that as well as harms, there are benefits to using social media, particularly for young people who are under-supported in their offline lives. [73%](https://about.au.reachout.com/blog/new-research-by-reachout-finds-young-people-are-scrolling-their-social-feeds-for-mental-health-support-but-platforms-are-not-safe-enough) of young people use social media for mental health support. Young people seeking help with their sexuality or gender, or who are being bullied or abused, use social media to communicate with their peers and build community.

Young people understand this and hold concerns regarding how the ban will affect vulnerable people in the community. Below are two comments made to the ABC by young people [surveyed](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-12-02/what-young-people-think-about-social-media-ban-btn-survey/106058976) about the ban:

"What happens to the children with mental health issues, disabilities or even living in remote areas? Social media can be the difference between having human connection and going without. Children who cannot go through school hallways without being called slurs and harassed use social media as a haven where they can find a community which provides support and understands their daily stressors." 

"I go to an online school in Adelaide, everyone here relies on social media to literally make and keep friends. The ban is created by neurotypicals for neurotypicals. I'm 16 so the ban doesn't "affect" me, however I haven't always been 16 but I have been a young person with mental health issues, I have been a young person who's been bullied and I have always and always will be a neurodivergent person who knows and has to deal with the struggle of making friends. The ban doesn't take into account ALL young Australians."

# Where to find help if you feel isolated because of the Social Media Ban

If you are a young person, or know a young person who has lost their online support network you may find the following resources useful:

* Minus18 is a LGBTQ+ organisation that frequently runs under 18 LGBTQ+ [events](https://www.minus18.org.au/events/) which provide youth with an opportunity to connect with other young LGBTQ+ individuals. 
* [YSAS](https://ysas.org.au/) offers support across Melbourne for youth experiencing mental health challenges including drug and alcohol use.
* For young people at risk of homelessness see Melbourne City Mission’s [Frontyard Youth Services](https://www.mcm.org.au/services/homelessness/frontyard).
* For boys aged 8-16 in the inner west of Melbourne see [here](https://ds.org.au/our-services/the-drum/) for ‘A supportive social and emotional space with dinner and activities, focusing on positive role modelling and emotional well-being’.
* [Headspace](https://headspace.org.au/) offers both study support and mental health support to youth across Australia.

# How will social media platforms know if I’m under or over 16?

## Age Assurance

The ten social media platforms are now required to take steps to ensure that users are over the age of 16.

There are a number of approved ways that platforms may attempt to verify that a user is over the age of 16. All of the methods have their own accuracy and privacy issues, which we discuss further below..

The Age Assurance Technology Trial identified and tested five approved methods by which platforms may verify a user's age. These are the three approved for use in the Social Media Ban:

* [Use of government issued documents](https://ageassurance.com.au/report/part-c/)
* [Facial recognition and age estimation ](https://ageassurance.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AATT_Part_D_DIGITAL.pdf)
* [AI driven profiling](https://ageassurance.com.au/report/part-e/)

Although not tested in the trial, tech platforms may also request banking information, such as credit card information to verify age. 

### Use of government issued documents

The first method is submitting government issued documents, including your Digital ID. While assurances were given that strong safeguards, including a “[double-blind](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/govpass-the-dtas-answer-to-australias-digital-id-problem-538856?)” system, would prevent unnecessary data collection, these assurances are now being [rolled back](https://www.digitalidsystem.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-11/departmental_responses_to_the_maddocks_privacy_impact_assessment_recommendations_nov2024_0.pdf?).

The problems with using government issued documents include both easy-to-bypass ID methods and serious privacy risks:

* Children can procure the photo ID of someone above the age threshold, perhaps by borrowing that of a parent or older sibling. 
* The individual’s identity will be shared and stored with a large internet platform - the same companies who regularly invade our privacy in order to sell targeted advertisements.
* The pervasive collection of Australians’ identity papers as they navigate the internet sets an expectation that our IDs are safe to share on the internet. This risks the proliferation of identity theft.
* Platforms must have an alternative option for age verification, so individuals cannot be forced to surrender government issued documents. 

### Facial recognition and age estimation

The second method for attempting to provide platforms with age assurance is age estimation through facial recognition. In practice this means uploading various angles of your face which is then compared to a massive dataset to determine an age estimate.

The problems with facial recognition for age estimation are well known and are problematic for a number of reasons:

* Biometric systems are unreliable, especially for [people of colour](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/sep/19/how-accurate-are-age-checks-for-australias-under-16s-social-media-ban-what-trial-data-reveals?), [women](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8525.pdf), and [young people](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8525.pdf) whose physical development varies significantly.
* Facial recognition technology becomes increasingly [inaccurate](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8525.pdf) as children age, meaning facial recognition errors are inevitable, especially for people close to the age threshold (e.g. 14-17). Women and people of colour are significantly [more likely](https://ageassurance.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AATT_Part_D_DIGITAL.pdf) to be inaccurately identified. 
* These age estimation systems can easily be [fooled](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-02/social-media-ban-vpns-masks-age-checks-disguises/105836134) by simple disguises, such as masks, and fake glasses with moustaches, highlighting their inadequacy.
* Facial recognition technology introduces large-scale biometric data collection, with heightened risks of breaches and misuse. Restricted sites will be handling sensitive biometric data without guardrails as to the deletion, use, retention or protection of such data. If this data is stored [overseas governments](https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/blog/the-chinese-communist-party-ccp-a-quest-for-data-control?) may be able to access incredibly sensitive data regarding Australians. 

### AI-driven profiling

AI-driven profiling infers a [user’s](https://ageassurance.com.au/publications/report-d/) age from [behavioural data](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/sep/16/australia-news-live-sydney-airport-social-media-ban-anthony-albanese-chris-bowen-climate-crisis-carbon-emissions-png-treaty-ntwnfb). This means using your search, post, or viewing history to determine your likely age.

This approach reinforces the data-extractive business models of online platforms, incentivising the collection of ever more granular personal data. AI-driven profiling requires the entity to already have this data stored in its database. This provides entities with a legally-grounded excuse to surveil users and collect granular personal data.

Such systems are error-prone and context-blind. For example:

* An adult who frequently consumes child-oriented content (e.g., animated films) might be misclassified as a child.
* A child accessing adult content might be classified as an adult, defeating the intended purpose. A child uses their parents YouTube account, resulting in a varied user watch history

These inaccuracies could lead to arbitrary access restrictions while legitimising harmful forms of surveillance capitalism.

### Credit card checks

Credit card checks assume that everyone who has a credit card is over the age of 18 and everyone over the age of 18 has a credit card. Credit cards are increasingly [unpopular](https://www.afterpay.com/en-AU/business/access/news/gen-z-credit-card-ick-report?) with young adults who prefer debit cards, creating a barrier for young adults to access the internet. Furthermore, many individuals over the age of 18 [cannot](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-17/why-seniors-are-being-refused-credit-cards/103728528?) access credit cards. 

Credit cards can easily be borrowed or stolen, making them a poor proxy for proving age. If credit card checks become commonplace, it will be easier for scammers to make fraudulent requests for credit card information creating new opportunities for scams, fraud, and exploitation.

# Skirting the ban

A [recent survey](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-12-02/what-young-people-think-about-social-media-ban-btn-survey/106058976) found that only 6% of Australian kids aged 9 to 15 believe the social media ban will work and that 75% plan on continuing social media use.

The social media ban only applies to accounts accessing the platforms from Australia, meaning that the ban can be skirted by accessing the platforms not logged in or through a [VPN](https://www.choice.com.au/electronics-and-technology/internet/connecting-to-the-internet/buying-guides/vpn-services). 

There are important considerations to be had when using these methods. Firstly, VPNs should be chosen carefully. Free VPNs have been known to introduce [malware](https://dig.watch/updates/fake-vpn-apps-linked-to-banking-malware-warn-security-experts) onto phones, [collect and sell](https://mashable.com/article/google-alert-vpn-user-data-stolen) user data and [screenshot passwords](https://ia.acs.org.au/article/2025/popular-free-vpn-caught-spying-on-users.html). See [here](http://privacyguides.org/en/vpn/#anti-censorship) and [here](https://privacy.net/best-vpn-for-privacy-anonymity/) for lists of recommended, privacy friendly VPNs. 

Using platforms such as TikTok without being logged in does not prevent the algorithm from learning what engages the user. In order to do this, the user will be shown a variety of different themes and their responses will [unknowingly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20231)[ influence ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20231)what they are shown next. This themed content can include things like [misogynistic content](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/feb/06/social-media-algorithms-amplifying-misogynistic-content), to which repeat exposure can [foster radicalisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20231). 

# The need for systemic reform

The harms posed by social media to children are both serious and complex. However, this ban does not address the root causes of those harms.

Young people deserve reform to address the underlying systems which enable the spread of harmful content: data extractive business models and algorithmic amplification.

Prohibiting access does nothing to change these fundamentally rights-abusive business models. Instead, the ban is a superficial solution that delays the need for meaningful, systemic reform.

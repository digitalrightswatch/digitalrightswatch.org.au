How well does your city know you? You'll be surprised by how much of your life can be pieced together from your metadata footprint – the traces you leave when you use everyday technology.

That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re joining forces with Melbourne Knowledge Week to put on a live hack of Candy Bowers – actor, activist, and hip hop artist; writer, comedian, and fierce feminist; poet, performer, and producer. We&#8217;ll track Candy as she makes her way through Melbourne, using a whole range of data sources: phone tower logs, Myki touch-ons, wi-fi signals and other digital records to reveal what she's doing – and who can find out. More importantly, we&#8217;ll discuss how this is occurring and what you can do about it.

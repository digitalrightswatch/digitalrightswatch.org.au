**We all need a right to delete our personal data**

Companies collect and use our information for all sorts of reasons. As part of doing this, they are typically required to gather our consent. However, consent is not a “one-and-done” statement - it’s an ongoing conversation. To have meaningful control over their information, we must be able to withdraw our consent. This is important right now with AI companies copying as much information about us as they can get their hands on. 

A right to delete would allow us to demand a company deletes our information. This will help us protect our privacy - reducing the chances of our information being leaked or misused.

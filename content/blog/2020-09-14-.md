We're calling on Australian local governments to incorporate human rights principles into their smart city digital platforms & initiatives.

[Image Description: an isometric design of a small city in blue, white, pink and green. There is an intersection of two streets lined with trees, buildings, houses and a small lake. In the middle of the buildings are 3D words that read: "Digital Rights Cities" and in the bottom left corner it reads: "A campaign for truly SMART cities brought to you by Digital Rights Watch.

The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the United Nations Human Rights Council is a unique process which involves a review of the human rights records of all UN Member States. The UPR process is designed to ensure equal treatment for every country when their human rights situations are assessed.

Access Now and Digital Rights Watch contributed a submission to Australia&#8217;s third UPR review cycle. The submission addresses the state of digital rights including the right to privacy and freedom of expression and access to information in Australia.

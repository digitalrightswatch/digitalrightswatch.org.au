As Australians consider how to cast their votes in the 2019 Federal Election, we wanted to ensure that some key digital rights policies are highlighted and addressed.

That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve compiled a handy scorecard of the major political party&#8217;s stance on these policy areas:

  * Protecting privacy, including policies on metadata retention, facial recognition and internet filters
  * The right to use encrypted communications, most notably around the support for the Assistance and Access Act 2018
  * Copyright reform, including support for safe harbour and fair use
  * Ethics in government use of citizen&#8217;s data, including Centrelink robo-debt, oversight of surveillance agencies and My Health Record rollout.<figure class="wp-block-image">

The fine print:

  * We [sent out a survey][2] to all major political parties, looked at their public policy platforms and analysed prior voting history.
  * The full detail of our analysis and ranking is [available here.][3]
  * We encourage voters to read further details on specific policies as available on political party websites.
  * We surveyed a selection of registered political parties, not independents, that are fielding candidates in the 2019 Federal Election.
  * Digital Rights Watch does not endorse or support any particular political party.

      &#8220;The internet is an amazing opportunity for young people to learn, communicate and to explore new worlds. Our booklet will help them enjoy all the benefits of the internet while protecting their personal information.&#8221;<br /> &#8211; Kirsten Fiedler, Managing Director of European Digital Rights.

    Children's freedom to explore and develop should not be limited due to lack of awareness of privacy-protecting strategies. The booklet helps them make safer and more informed choices about what to share and how to share online. It includes chapters on what privacy actually is, how to use safer messaging systems and how to improve the security of smartphones.

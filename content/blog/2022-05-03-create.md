Artists who use digital platforms to promote, stream, and sell their music experience unique issues and challenges. From exploitative pay-per-stream models to the impact of recommendation algorithms on building a listener base; modern musicians need to do so much more than just make music.

As musicians navigate self-promotion on social media, distribution on digital platforms and the ongoing toll of the pandemic, join Digital Rights Watch and Music Victoria for a night of music and discussion with some of Melbourne's emerging artists to explore how we can rebalance the internet economy to work for local creatives.

**Who&#8217;s speaking:**

  * **Eilish Gilligan**&#8211; Local artist, music writer, producer, and founder of Star Crossed PR
  * **Will Evans**&#8211; Bandcamp Artist and Label Ambassador for Australia and New Zealand
  * **Jake Cleland**&#8211; Information security consultant and former music critic with over 10 years experience reporting on music and culture
  * **Glenn Bennie**&#8211; National Education and Outreach representative for APRA AMCOS, assisting over 100,000 artists across Australia and NZ manage copyright and royalties
  * **Cerisa Grant**&#8211; proud Walpiri, Gurindji and Jawoyn woman, and a First Nations Community Engagement Officer and Social Worker at Support Act.

Back in 2013, [David Byrne said][1] that "the internet will suck all creative content out of the world." Almost 10 years on, is he right? How are digital platforms changing the creative process, quality, and diversity of music that artists can create, and listeners can enjoy?

Spotify CEO [said that][2] "artists today that are making it realize that it's about creating a continuous engagement with their fans," he continued. "It is about putting the work in." We're not convinced that constant engagement and output is best for the arts. What might a better model look like?

CREATE is the final event in Digital Rights Watch's community-based research project on [_Rebalancing the Internet Economy_][3]. The project explores how we can build a global internet for local needs that balances power between creators and digital platforms.

**Join us for a panel discussion featuring artists, music industry leaders, and digital platform experts, followed by a special performance from [Eilish Gilligan][4].**

Digital Rights Watch has joined with dozens of organisations and academics in signing an open letter about the EU’s proposed Regulation on Preventing the Dissemination of Terrorist Content Online, and in particular the Regulation’s call for Internet hosts to use “proactive measures” to detect terrorist content.

Key concerns include:

  * Lack of transparency of how the database works, and its effectiveness, proportionality and appropriateness to achieve the goals the Terrorist Content Regulation aims to achieve.
  * How filters are unable to understand the context and therefore they are error-prone.
  * Regardless of the possibility of filters to be accurate in the future, the pervasive online monitoring on disadvantaged and marginalised individuals.

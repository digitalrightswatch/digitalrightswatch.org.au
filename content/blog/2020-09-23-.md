We think that local councils have a \*huge\* opportunity to lead the way in creating truly smart cities by making sure our human rights are upheld as communities embrace more technology and digital innovation. We think a truly SMART city should be:- Surveillance free- Mindful with data &#8211; Accessible & inclusive &#8211; Rights-respecting &#8211; Transparent To get councils around Australia on board, we need to share the word. We'd love for you to share this campaign with your channels! You can also write to your local council directly through our webite if you head to: drw.fyi/cities or the link in our bio!

Digital Rights Watch (DRW) welcomes the opportunity to submit comments to the Productivity Commission in response to the interim report regarding the “Harnessing Data and Digital Technology” inquiry. DRW is excited for the possibilities digital technology brings to our lives. The Internet has done wonderful things for humanity and we can’t wait for the next wave of life-improving technology



However, we are also concerned by the threats that new technology, particularly in the hands of powerful companies and governments, can pose to our human rights and wellbeing. As there are many companies commenting on the supposed benefits of their AI-driven tools, in this submission we focus on areas of concern - particularly those areas where we believe that the Productivity Commission has taken a wrong turn in its interim report.

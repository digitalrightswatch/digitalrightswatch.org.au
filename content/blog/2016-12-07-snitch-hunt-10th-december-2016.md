  This Human Rights Day, 10th December, get a taste of the power of metadata surveillance, and compete to see who can best abuse it.
</p>

<p class="normal">
  Experience the thrill of working as a data analyst! You are working for the police force, and your task is to dig into the metadata and track down the whistleblower. You don&#8217;t need to be a technical wizard to solve these challenges. If you can work a web browser, you can hunt snitch!
</p>

  Register now, then come and join us at the University of Melbourne on Human Rights Day, Saturday 10th December.

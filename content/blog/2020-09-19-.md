Australia's annual internet governance conference, NetThing, is coming up in under two weeks! Over 1-2 October there are two full days of panels, discussions and workshops all about the internet, security, digital platforms, policy, censorship, and more! And it's all free and online! We're particularly stoked to have played a part in organising this panel on censorship and expression online. We'll be talking about content moderation/policing, impacts on BIPOC, queer, trans and non binary voices, disabled folx and fat activists in online spaces, laws like SESTA/FOSTA and how they are relevant in an Australian context and overall how we can aim to minimise harm online. The speakers are awesome: @yassmin_a @lovelolahunt Claire Fitzsimmons is @salty.world and Celeste Carnegie.It's going to be great. Don't miss out! Register to attend at www.netthing.org.au [Image Description: four pictures of speakers on a white background with text that reads: censorship and expression, whose voices are elevated and whose are silenced online?, 1st October 2020 3:45pm AEST, free.

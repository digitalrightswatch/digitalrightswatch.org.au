Today, Access Now announces its selection of Lizzie O’Shea, an Australian human rights lawyer, broadcaster, and writer, as a recipient of this year’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.accessnow.org/heroes-villains-awards/" target="_blank">Human Rights Heroes Award</a>. O’Shea is recognized for leading work to highlight, analyze, and protest expansive surveillance laws in Australia. 

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet will present the award to O’Shea, as well as this year’s four other winners, at <a href="https://www.rightscon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>RightsCon Tunis</strong></a> (June 11-14, 2019).

After a more than a year in development, in September 2018, the Australian government <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/what-we-think-you-should-know-about-australias-new-encryption-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> legislation expanding law enforcement’s powers to break <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/Crypto-Australia-Memo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">encryption</a> protocols. Despite widespread public dissent, Parliament rushed to pass the bill in December 2018, with the promise it would be further reviewed in 2019.

Frequently working in coalition, O’Shea has <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/opinion/australia-encryption-surveillance-bill.html" target="_blank">led</a> the campaign against the Assistance and Access Bill and other threats to secure communications in Australia. This has included building an alliance across technology companies, civil society organizations, academics, and activists, and fronting media, public events, and parliamentary inquiries. Despite the laws being passed, the campaign had a huge mobilizing impact, with a strong coalition committed to working together and thousands of Australian citizens sparked to take action.

O’Shea is a <a href="https://digitalrightswatch.org.au/about/our-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">board member</a> at Digital Rights Watch and recently published a <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/2960-future-histories" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book</a> on the politics and history of digital technology.

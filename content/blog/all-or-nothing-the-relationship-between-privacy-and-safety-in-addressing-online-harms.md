To better understand the relationship between privacy and safety in addressing online harms, Digital Rights Watch has commissioned a research report featuring polling conducted by [Essential Media](https://essentialmedia.com.au/). It covers some topical technologies like facial recognition and age assurance tech, client-side scanning in CSAEM detection, and methods of improving safety without impacting privacy. 

**We do not believe that a safer internet requires giving up our privacy.** There is strong support for privacy reforms in Australia, more so than indiscriminately banning children from social media. We are more sceptical about the idea of using AI to police web safety, unconvinced that these techno-centric approaches will create safer online environments.

This polling research should reinforce the need to carefully think through approaches to improving online safety and ensuring that any form of age or identity verification includes appropriate safeguards and protections.

Each time a politician says something ridiculous about tech, we cringe, we shake our heads in disbelief, we roast them on twitter. But it's too easy to fall into the trap of thinking that harmful political decisions involving tech must come from a place of naivety. It makes us think: "if only we can raise awareness, if we can help them understand, then things will be better!"But, as Scott Ludlam reminded us (thanks Scott!) earlier in the year at one of our events, it's not as simple as educating politicians about tech, because in a lot of cases they know \*exactly\* what they're doing, they see the risks (or maybe they only see 'opportunities'? ), and they do it anyway.Too bleak for a Monday? Our bad. [Image Description: blue writing on a pink background that reads: "It's true that some politicians don't understand the tech. But what is more alarming is when they know \*exactly\* what they're doing. Facial recognition for mass surveillance and the recent ASIO bill are not based on technical ignorance— it's brute politics and power accumulation. &#8211; Scott Ludlam']#politics #auspol #auspolitics #humanrights #digitalrights #privacy #surveillance #facialrecognition #technology #tech

The _Online Safety Act_ commenced in January 2022. It provides broad powers to the online safety regulator, the eSafety Commissioner.

In November 2023, the Minister for Communications the Hon Michelle Rowland MP announced a statutory review into the operation of the Act.

Digital Rights Watch has actively participated throughout the development of the Online Safety Act and its related parts, such as the Basic Online Safety Expectations and the online safety industry standards.

**As always, we emphasise that privacy and digital security are essential to uphold safety.**

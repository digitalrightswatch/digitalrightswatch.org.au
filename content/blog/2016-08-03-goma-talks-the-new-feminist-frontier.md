I really enjoyed talking about feminism, online abuse, and regulation at Brisbane's [Gallery of Modern Art][1] recently. You can watch the video below.

We were told that new technology would unshackle women from the domestic duties of the home, and yet in the 21st century women's experience of online and social media is one of abuse, exclusion and exploitation. From trolling, to gaming and online culture, is technology feminism's new frontier?

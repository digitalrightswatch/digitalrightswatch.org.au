<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we're proud to release the <em>State of Digital Rights</em> report, which outlines the many </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ways Australians' rights are being impacted by the activities of private companies and governments in the online world. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The internet is often touted as the new frontier of freedom of expression, described simultaneously as a wide open plain free from heavy-handed intervention &#8211; or a lawless landscape that political leaders struggle to understand and fail to police. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vast amounts of our lives now take place online, including paid employment, participating in democracy and communicating with government and with each other.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This can be liberating: it is possible to engage with the internet anonymously, to communicate secretly and access services and communities that allow us to be ourselves, without fear of judgement. But there is also a dark side to life in the digital age that includes surveillance of populations, tracking of individual movements or conversations and data-matching on a global scale. It's clear that corporate and government power over our digital lives need to be kept in check.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The State of Digital Rights</em> aims to support, enhance and promote the necessary debate, through analysing the key digital rights issues facing Australians today, and making clear recommendations for policy makers to adopt.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Key recommendations included in the <em>State of Digital Rights</em> include:</span>

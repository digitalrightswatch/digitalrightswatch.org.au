The UN Special Rapporteur on the protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression is conducting [a study on freedom of expression in the telecommunications and Internet access sector][1]. He will examine State regulation and action that affect access to telecommunications and Internet networks and services, particularly those provided by Telcos and ISPs.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We see a fundamental connection between freedom of expression, digital privacy and a free and open internet, and so we&#8217;ve taken this opportunity to provide the Special Rapporteur with a submission, outlining a number of areas in which these values are compromised in laws and practices in Australia.</span>

These include:

  * Australia&#8217;s mandatory data retention regime

  * Recent changes to our copyright system, including the website blocking regime

  * Executive powers over the telecommunications industry

  * Removal of content at the request of the eSafety Commissioner

  * The Australian Privacy principles

  * The growing digital divide within Australia

  * Overall approaches toward standards and governance of Telcos, privacy, technology and the internet

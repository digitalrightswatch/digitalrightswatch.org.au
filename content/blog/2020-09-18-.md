Did you catch DRW Campaigner, Samantha Floreani, on ABC News talking about TikTok earlier in the week? Sam highlighted how the ongoing TikTok saga is about so much more than silly dance videos. It has become a symbol of the geopolitical tensions between the US and China, and demonstrates the extent to which states will go to be able to maintain control over information flows. Too much of the current focus is on which tech giant (and which government) gets more power, rather than challenging the underlying data-hungry, privacy-invasive models of these platforms. Instead of asking if surveillance capitalism is the dynamic we WANT to participate in, we're asking who gets a bigger slice of the pie. It's about who gets the power, rather than grappling with the power structures themselves. The issues are not unique to TikTok. We want to see all big platforms held accountable, treating our privacy as a priority and emphasising algorithmic transparency.

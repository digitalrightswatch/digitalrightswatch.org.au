Yesterday, the Australian Government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/31/roadmap-for-age-verification-online-pornographic-material-adult-websites-australia-law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released the eSafety Commissioner&#8217;s long-awaited roadmap for age verification for online pornography</a>. We are pleased to see that the federal government will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/31/roadmap-for-age-verification-online-pornographic-material-adult-websites-australia-law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not force websites to implement age verification as a result of concerns about privacy and the lack of maturity of the technology</a>.

Age verification is rife with privacy and digital security risks, as well as critical effectiveness and implementation issues. We welcome this sensible announcement from the Australian government.

We have been fighting this proposal for close to three years. Over that period, we made eight submissions related to online safety and age verification, advocated in the media, participated in many consultation roundtables and workshops with government and industry, and collaborated with other privacy and security advocates, researchers, and community groups.

**This win shows that when we raise the alarm and put pressure on government we can stop harmful and invasive tech policy proposals. We need to keep up the fight to protect human rights, wellbeing and safety.**

Online safety is a highly politicised area, replete with plenty of troubling tech ideas â€” from attempts to undermine end-to-end encryption to broad powers for content takedowns to proposals for client-side scanning. This isn&#8217;t the first time that an invasive and flawed approach like age verification has been proposed, and it likely won&#8217;t be the last. With your ongoing support, we will continue to watch for, and fight back against, infringements on our collective digital rights.

#### **Age verification does more harm than good**

Age verification is privacy-invasive, which undermines the objective of reducing online harm. Most forms of age verification require the provision of additional personal information in order to be effective. Incentivising companies and government agencies to collect, use and store additional personal information in order to conduct age verification creates additional privacy and security risk, which in-turn can exacerbate online harms.

Age Verificationand Restricted Access Systemshave been considered in Australia and overseas in the past but have failed to be implemented due to their overreach, blunt approach, unreasonable impact upon individual's privacy, and the creation of adverse digital security risks.

We are concerned that any of the existing approaches to age verification will require the provision of personal information that goes well beyond proof-of-age. There are significant, if not insurmountable, challenges to implementing age verification in a way that is both effective, as well as minimising privacy and security risk.

Mandatory age verification is likely to act as a deterrent for many adults accessing legal content, and may prompt people of all ages toward less safe and secure internet services in order to circumnavigate providing personal information. Further, we remain concerned that many of the current approaches to AV are relatively easily bypassed, for example, by use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

The combination of these factors are likely to result in a system which is unduly invasive in data collection, creates new privacy and security risks by holding information on individuals, and yet is unlikely to be effective at preventing people under the age of 18 from accessing restricted content. We are therefore concerned that the outcome will be a system that is not simply ineffective but actively harmful.

There are many technological approaches to age verification.

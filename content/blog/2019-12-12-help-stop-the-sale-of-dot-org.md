It was [recently revealed][1] that the nonprofit that owns the .ORG domain registry was planning to sell it to a private equity firm, Ethos Capital. This could impact the millions of individuals and organizations that have a .ORG website, subjecting them to potential censorship and leaving the door open for price increases on domain registration and renewals.

The .ORG top-level domain and all of the nonprofit organizations that depend on it are at risk if a private equity firm is allowed to buy control of it. This deal would give Ethos Capital the power to censor the speech of NGOs to advance commercial interests, and to extract ever-growing monopoly rents from those same nonprofits.

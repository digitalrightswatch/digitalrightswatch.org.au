Today, our friends at Access Now successfully delivered [the #KeepitOn petition][1] today at the Internet Governance Forum in Guadalajara, Mexico.

They presented remarks at a session of the Freedom Online Coalition (a coalition of 30 governments supporting human rights in the digital age), and then delivered the 1,006-page petition to government officials, which reads:  
**&#8220;To the worldâ€™s governments, I urge you to publicly commit to keep the internet on. Internet shutdowns harm human rights and the economy.&#8221;**

Thanks to everyone who signed the petition and to those who are fighting against shutdowns everyday.  
#KeepitOn.

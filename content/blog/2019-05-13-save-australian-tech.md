The Australian technology sector is generating new jobs and creating the industries that will house the jobs of the future.

But new laws passed by the Australian Government are risking this critical industry â€“ and at the same time undermining Australian citizens' rights to privacy and an open and secure internet.

Current Government legislation is stifling our industry's ability to grow and forcing companies and technology workers to move offshore.

Australian companies are already reporting that they are losing overseas contracts for clients who no longer feel confident to use products impacted by the legislation. The international reputation of the Australian technology industry has been significantly undermined and opportunities for growth curtailed.

The impact of new legislation means companies operating or based in Australia are not able to act in the best interest of their customers, or guarantee their privacy. Overall cybersecurity and the human rights of Australians using the internet are both being undermined.

Join us and show your support for a strong Australian technology sector that protects our privacy and creates jobs for the sector.

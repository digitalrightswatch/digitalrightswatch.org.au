Australia's copyright law is hopelessly out of date. Things that we all take for granted – forwarding emails; quoting; making and sharing memes; cloud storage – are often illegal in Australia. Fair use would fix this.

Right now the government is considering whether to introduce fair use. Let's tell them – we need fair use now.

[Take action &#8211; write to your local MP and tell them you support a fair copyright system.][1]

The Australian government is currently considering its response to the Productivity Commission&#8217;s inquiry into intellectual property. One of the central recommendations of that inquiry, and something that we strongly pushed for [in our own submission][2], was the introduction of fair use.

If Australia wants a world class education system, modern economy, flourishing cultural sector and laws that make sense then we need to tell the government to introduce fair use now.

[Join the campaign for a fair copyright system.][1]

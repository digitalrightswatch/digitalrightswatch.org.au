At DRW, our team is made up of people who love, use and build technology. We're vehemently \*not\* anti-technology. But what we DO take issue with, is the development and use of tech that impedes on human rights and exacerbates existing inequalities. Facial recognition might be a cool or interesting tech problem to solve, but we should always be asking what other problems are being created or amplified in the process. We'll keep on pushing for the use of facial recognition technology for mass surveillance to be banned- it's just straight up not compatible with the kind of rights-respecting society we want to live in.

Say no to facial recognition for mass surveillance."]

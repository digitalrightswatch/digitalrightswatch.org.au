Freedom of expression, privacy, freedom of association and freedom from discrimination – these are all important digital rights which all started off life as fundamental human rights in the pre-Internet world.

This panel workshop at the [Australian Internet Governance Forum][1] in October 2016looked at the development of digital rights in Australia and assess the current state of play.

As the only major Western democracy without an enforceable Bill of Rights, and a key player in the Five Eyes surveillance partnership uncovered by Edward Snowden, where does that leave us and our rights online? What about the safety and interests of women, LGBTQ Australians, refugees, Indigenous Australians, legal and medical professionals, journalists and members of minority religions online? What are the initiatives here in Australia fighting for our rights?

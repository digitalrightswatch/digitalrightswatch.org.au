#### _**Our right to privacy is essential to uphold our democracy, rein in corporate power, and for a safe and fair digital future. It's time to get privacy right.**_



Privacy is a human right, but too many companies and government agencies are getting it wrong.

Australia&#8217;s _Privacy Act_ does not adequately protect people&#8217;s privacy. It is woefully out of date and unfit for purpose in the modern digital economy. It&#8217;s time for the Australian government to bring Australia&#8217;s privacy protections into the 21st century.

#### Invading privacy is big business, and companies will try to weaken these reforms. We need to keep up the public pressure and make sure this chance to secure real privacy reform isn&#8217;t wasted.

#### Join the fight to get privacy right. Here&#8217;s what you can do:

We&#8217;ve joined forces with a coalition of public health organisations and children&#8217;s rights group calling for robust privacy reform to better protect all of us &#8211; including children. **<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/parents-for-privacy-reform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Add your name to the open letter here.</a></span>** You don&#8217;t need to be a parent &#8211; guardians, family members and allies are all welcome!

Stay tuned for more opportunities to get involved in the privacy reform campaign &#8211; make sure you&#8217;ve signed up to our mailing list!

Digital Rights Watch has provided a submission to the Attorney-General&#8217;s review of the _Privacy Act 1988._ To understand our stance on the Australian privacy landscape and the rationale behind our submission, check out [this blog post][1].

The recommendations from our submission to the consultation, are as follows:

  * Redefine the scope and reach of the Privacy Act.
  * Update the definition of personal information.
  * Adopt a rights-based approach.
  * Introduce a statutory tort for invasions of privacy.
  * Don't use consent as a scape-goat to weak protections of personal information.
  * Abolish exemptions, namely the exemption for political messaging.
  * Introduce a stronger definition of 'de-identified' data.

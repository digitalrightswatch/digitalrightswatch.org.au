Each year, we invite activists, writers, academics, and technologists to reflect upon the **State of Digital Rights**. It is our hope that the analysis and policy recommendations contained in this report will document important tech policy developments, contribute to nuanced public debate on digital rights issues in Australia, and assist the growth of the digital rights movement into the future.

_&#8220;We collate this report as part of a commitment to building a vibrant and diverse community of people who think about digital rights from all angles. We want to encourage conversations, not dictate them, so would welcome your feedback. Notwithstanding the grave problems we face, we remain optimistic about the future of our movement, and the role technology can play in facilitating human rights. If you share this vision, please consider joining us.&#8221;_ &#8211; **Lizzie O&#8217;Shea, Chair of Digital Rights Watch**

Digital Rights Watch has also published [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">2018</span>][1] and [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">2020</span>][2] editions of the report.

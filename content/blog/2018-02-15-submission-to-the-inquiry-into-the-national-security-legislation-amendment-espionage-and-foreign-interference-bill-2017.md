Our submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee&#8217;s review of the [National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017.][1]

It is our view that national security agencies already have significant powers to deal with threats to national security, and that this Bill fails to take into account the balance between freedom of speech and protecting Australia's citizens.</span>

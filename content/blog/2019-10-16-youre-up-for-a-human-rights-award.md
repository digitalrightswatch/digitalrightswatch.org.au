We&#8217;ve got some amazing news to share with you.

Digital Rights Watch has just been announced as <a href="http://www.humanrights.gov.au/about/news/first-finalists-announced-human-rights-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="a finalist for the Australian Human Rights Award (opens in a new tab)">a finalist for the Australian Human Rights Award</a>.

The Human Rights Awards is the pinnacle of human rights recognition in Australia. Each year the Human Rights Commission recognises the outstanding contribution of individuals and organisations in promoting and protecting human rights and freedoms.

This nomination is an important recognition of the need for solid digital rights protections in this country. Our human rights have consistently been compromised by successive governments, through the Assistance and Access Act, the mandatory metadata retention scheme, increased spying powers and countless other pieces of legislation.

But in the face of all this, we&#8217;re proud to fight for the digital rights of all Australians. And the important thing is that <a href="https://digitalrightswatch.org.au/join/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="we couldn't do it without you (opens in a new tab)">we couldn&#8217;t do it without you</a>.

Passionate and engaged people like you, who stand up to support this work &#8211; writing to Members of Parliament, speaking out in media, and [helping to fund our work][1] &#8211; are crucial to our ongoing efforts to raise the profile of human rights in online spaces.

So, thank you. This award is as much about you as it is about this organisation.

Finalists for the awards will be announced at a ceremony on Dec 12 &#8211; we&#8217;ll let you know if we win!

The Digital Rights Watch team: Tim, Lizzie, Dave, Sam, Vanessa, Tom, Nic, Lilly, Rose, Erin & Elissa.

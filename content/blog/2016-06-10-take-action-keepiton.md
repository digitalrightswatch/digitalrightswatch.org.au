Internet shutdowns happen when governments order companies to cut off access to communications tools — like Twitter, SMS, or Facebook. Unfortunately, companies often comply with these government orders, even when they happen during elections.

Internet shutdowns pose a threat to human rights around the world. They **harm everyone:**businesses, emergency services, journalism, human rights defenders, and demonstrators. They don't help victims or restore order. **Even worse, they're increasing** — in 2015 alone we recorded more than 15 shutdowns worldwide.

That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve joined forces with Access Now and 70+ other organisations around the world in the [#KeepItOn campaign][1].

[Take the pledge and join us to push back against internet shutdowns and help #KeepItOn!][2]

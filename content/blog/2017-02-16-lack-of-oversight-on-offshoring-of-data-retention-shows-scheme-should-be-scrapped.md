Digital Rights Watch has renewed calls for Australia&#8217;s mandatory data retention scheme to be scrapped, after revelations that the Government has no oversight over whether telecommunication companies are storing data outside of Australia&#8217;s borders.

&#8220;When this legislation was first introduced, it was predicated on telcos having to detail their data storage capacity, processes and security arrangements. Now we learn that the Attorney General&#8217;s department has no idea where in the world this is occurring,&#8221; said Digital Rights Watch Chair Tim Singleton Norton.

At a parliamentary committee hearing into telecommunication security reforms today, the Attorney-General&#8217;s Department revealed it had no oversight or knowledge into the level of offshoring currently in use for the mandatory data retention scheme.

&#8220;The data retention scheme and associated mass surveillance operations such as the plan for a national facial biometric data capability have massive consequences for the privacy of ordinary people.&#8221;

&#8220;Australians' rights to privacy are being compromised by widespread warrantless surveillance without adequate safeguards", Mr Singleton Norton said.

&#8220;These revelation just serve as validation that the scheme was hastily designed from the outset, with little regard for the privacy protections of individual citizens.&#8221;

&#8220;Telcos don&#8217;t want this scheme, the public doesn&#8217;t want it and it has received condemnation from human rights experts worldwide. It&#8217;s about time this government recognise this and scrap the data retention regime,&#8221; he concluded.

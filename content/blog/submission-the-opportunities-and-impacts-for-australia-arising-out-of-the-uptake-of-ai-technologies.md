We need not look to far-future hypothetical scenarios to understand the ways in which AI can cause harm: it is already happening. There is over a decade of case studies from around the world, research, analysis and recommendations to draw from. More than ever before, Australia is in a position to move from identifying problems and toward taking steps to remediate and mitigate them. Digital Rights Watch urges the committee to take this task seriously, and to recognise that there is nothing about AI that is inevitable. The government can—and should—intervene.

Critically, much of the AI hype—both negative and positive—serves the interests of companies who stand to profit the most from widespread adoption of their products in a low regulation environment. We should not allow our laws and policy to be shaped by AI Industry leaders for their own purposes, especially given that those leaders are generally not based in Australia, and represent a different set of values that do not always apply well in the Australian context.

The Australian Government have released a draft Bill [[The Assistance and Access Bill 2018]][1] designed to compel device manufacturers and service providers to assist law enforcement in accessing encrypted information. Although apparently developed to allow government agencies access to criminals&#8217; encrypted communications, the Bill also grants broad, sweeping powers to government agencies that will harm the security and stability of our communications and the internet at large.

<p style="text-align:left">
  The government asked the public for feedback, with submissions closing on September 10, 2018.<br />
</p>

**Here&#8217;s our top three concerns with this Bill:**

  1. Creates obligations on technology producers and communication providers, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">forcing them to work for law enforcement agencies</span>;

  2. Creates powers that would <span style="text-decoration: underline;">allow police to seize information directly</span> from a device; and
  3. Allows government operatives to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">access more data</span> through current warrants.


The government consultation period on this draft legislation has now closed, but you can [read the full detail of our concerns in our submission to the government.][2] Rest assured, this is not the end of the fight &#8211; we&#8217;ll keep working to ensure that encryption is protected.

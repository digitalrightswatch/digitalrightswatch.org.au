In October 2021, the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) completed [Phase Three of the consultation process][1] for Australia&#8217;s proposed _Trusted Digital Identity Bill_ and the accompanying Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF) Accreditation Scheme, and the Trusted Digital Identity (TDI) rules.

Digital Rights Watch has been an active participant in the ongoing consultation process. You can [read our submission to the Digital Identity Position Paper in Phase Two of the consultation here][2].

**Summary of our recommendations included in this submission:**

  * Prioritise an update to the Privacy Act
  * Introduce robust data protection and handling rules for accredited entities
  * The Oversight Authority (OA) should be split into two offices, to separate the responsibility for operational functionality of the scheme and accountabilty and integrity of the scheme
  * Prohibit the use of digital identity data for enforcement purposes
  * Do not integrate biometric data into the TDIF
  * Ensure that the digital identity framework remains truly voluntary
  * Maintain analouge pathways for individuals to interact with, and use, services
  * Ensure that there are easy ways to alter consent, and delete or alter data

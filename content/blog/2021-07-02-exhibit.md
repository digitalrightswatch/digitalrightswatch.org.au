What is art? What is pornography? A contested distinction that was once made by adult stores, galleries, and the classification board, now falls to digital platforms and their automated content moderation algorithms.Censorship debates date back centuries, and our public discussions, legislation, and tech policies are still riddled with moralistic ideology about what is 'good', what is 'bad' and what the general public should be allowed to see.

The EXHIBIT event is the first of our four-part event series as part of our community-based research project to _[Rebalance the Internet Economy][1]_. The EXHIBIT event is centered on the experiences of sex workers, artists, and content creators.

The internet was heralded as a place where freedom of expression would thrive, and yet marginalised and minoritised voices continue to be silenced online: sex workers are regularly de-platformed, Black, Brown and Indigenous peoples are more heavily policed, LGBTQ+ content creators are 'shadow banned', and nudity policies disproportionately impact some over others. How are these policies communicated? Can individuals have a say when their livelihoods depend on it?

The rise in hate speech, misinformation, online abuse, and bullying calls for meaningful policy and regulation but it is essential we get the balance right. All over the world we are seeing an increasing trend toward heavy-handed removal of content based on a moral standing, not an evidence-based or harm reduction one. <a href="https://digitalrightswatch.org.au/2021/02/11/explainer-the-online-safety-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Australia's Online Safety Bill</a> is a prime example of when the regulatory focus is too heavily invested in content over context.It&#8217;s time we had a frank conversation about what needs to change to better serve individuals.

**As it stands we have policy and regulation that protects morals rather than people**—but we need it to be the other way around in order for our communities to thrive online. Join us to hear from our panelists and share your (yes, your!) perspective!

      <em>April Hélène-Horton is a writer, public speaker and model &#8211; you might know her better as The Bodzilla (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/thebodzilla/">@thebodzilla</a>).</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>In February 2021, she led the way as Australia's first truly plus size models to appear in a bikini on a billboard. Before that, she'd spent a year building the identity of 'The Bodzilla' to give a real voice to her passion for self-love and body acceptance.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>The rise of anti-racism into mainstream conversation meant that the absence of representation she had felt keenly growing up was becoming another key part of her online work. April knew she needed not only to speak to her friends and family about fat positivity and anti-racism, but to anyone who would listen.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Her experiences of online censorship plus the ongoing fight to amplify marginalised voices above the sounds of the bots and community guidelines bring her to the Digital Rights Watch panel event to discuss how we Rebalance the Internet Economy.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>The world might not be ready for marginalised bodies to take up space but The Bodzilla is here to make room for everyone and show the door to anyone who wants to peddle diet culture and harmful BS based on social conditioning and bias.</em>

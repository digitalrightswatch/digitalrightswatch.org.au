<span style="font-weight: 400;">An independent inquiry is needed to restore faith in the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Government's ability to handle online privacy, according to online advocacy organization Digital Rights Watch.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Turnbull Government's handling of last night's online Census demonstrates both a total disrespect for personal privacy rights and lack of digital literacy," said Digital Rights Watch board member Amy Gray.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"We need an independent investigation of the whole process, including a forensic report of the cause of the website crash, the handling of privacy concerns and the outsourcing of key services to private companies.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Australian Census is a vital social and government planning tool but the handling of privacy concerns and education campaign by the Australian Bureau of Statistics has been a debacle from start to finish.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"Now they are botching the explanation of what happened to cause the website to crash and making people even more distrustful of providing their information.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"To deal with this mess, the ABS should act immediately to address people's main privacy concerns, including at a bare minimum informing the public that they will not be fined if they choose to leave name and address data blank.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"In the longer term, the retention of name and address data should always be at the discretion of the citizen.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Census is too important to boycott, but who would blame people for doing that after everything that has happened?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"The ABS should start again with a proper consultation process that includes civil society and privacy advocates, and not just an internal assessment," said Ms Gray.</span>

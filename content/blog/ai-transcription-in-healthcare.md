**AI transcription software is being increasingly rolled out across Australia**, including in General Practice, Specialist, and Pediatric care settings.

While there is potential for increased efficiency afforded healthcare professionals by using AI to transcribe and summarise appointments, we know there are serious risks associated with this practice.

### **Bias**

Overseas studies have shown the implicit bias within AI transcription software, meaning that already marginalised communities are at risk from AI transcription and summary biases. This could come through minimising symptoms based on gender, inaccurate transcription based on accent or English language proficiency, or hallucinatory inputs in summarising transcription.

### **Privacy**

It is unclear where these confidential transcripts and summaries are being held, whether the data is moved offshore, and whether it is deleted in a timely manner. Such personal and private data needs to be kept in Australia, protected from data breaches, and deleted after use.

### **Right to Refuse**

There is no blanket assurance that members of the public have to be able to refuse their sensitive medical information being transcribed and / or summarised using AI software. Anyone should have the right for a ‘no questions asked’ refusal of the use of AI scribes in a medical setting.

### **Worker Rights**

While AI transcription tools have the potential to increase efficiency for doctors, this should not come at the expense of doctor-to-patient ratios or shortening the length of Medicare rebated appointment times.

We’ll be working hard to make sure the introduction of AI into healthcare is done with privacy and safety at the forefront.

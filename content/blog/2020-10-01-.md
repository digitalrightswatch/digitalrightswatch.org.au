Fighting to uphold human rights can feel like a gargantuan task in the face of rampant surveillance capitalism, technology that evolves at the pace of a dystopian sci-fi, and a government with its heart set on using it in new and creative ways to spy on everyday people. We get it. It's exhausting. That's why we're bringing the focus back down to the local level. You know the phrase: 'think global, act local'? It's like that, but instead of buying your veggies from the farmers market (I mean, do that too, that's also good), we're asking local councils to embed human rights into their digital initiatives. But if we're going to get them to do it, they need to know that it's something you care about! Head to drw.fyi/cities or the link in our bio and we'll help you write to them to get them on board. ✍️[Image Description: in the bottom left corner is a small isometric city in pink, blue and green, amongst 3D text that reads: "Digital Rights Cities." The background is half yellow, half white, and the main text reads: "SMART: Electric vehicles on our roads. NOT SMART: Mass surveillance on our streets."]#smartcity #smartcities #digitalrights #humanrights #privacy #dataprivacy #surveillance #council #localcouncil #auspol #auspolitics #dataprotection

**AI is transforming our world at rapid speed, raising urgent questions about who benefits, who loses, and how we keep control of the future.**

While the boosters of AI are rushing to transform the world, citizens are being left in the slipstream, with little chance to influence how this new technology takes shape.

**You’re invited to a free live discussion hosted by the Burning Platforms podcast where panellists explore the promises and pitfalls of AI - and what’s at stake for all Australians.**

Our fun and interactive panel event will canvas the big questions and try to come up with a few answers before this juggernaut goes out of control.

**Come along to meet and mingle with people who care.**

\- Learn about the Luddites and how the future can be contested

\- Try to tell the difference between an AI and a human

\- Ask the tough questions: who knows? who decides? and who decides who decides?

Featuring special guests from politics and entertainment.

We&#8217;re only a few days away from the Saturday reckoning of Election 2019, and it hasn&#8217;t been the best campaign for your human rights online. Here&#8217;s a quick overview of the major news stories, policies and announcements so far:

[Last week we released our election scorecard][1], ranking each of the political parties on their track record and policies on issues such as privacy, encryption, copyright and ethical government use of a data. We&#8217;ve also seen a good response to this [from the Science Party][2], who weren&#8217;t included in our initial survey.

Labor were keen to promote their planned $25 million investment in [regional digital skills development][3], but have also stuck to their line to [amend (not repeal)][4] the Assistance and Access Act. [We&#8217;ve pointed out][5] that the latter will massively impact the success of the former.

The Greens have been one of the only parties to truly focus on digital rights during the campaign, with [this interview from Senator Steele-John][6] outlining the pro-active approach that his party will take. His former staffer Penny Kyburz is also running for a Senate spot and has a [particular interest and focus on digital rights][7].

Independent candidate for the Senate in the ACT Anthony Pesec has taken a strong stance on [removing the exemption to the Privacy Act][8] currently enjoyed by politicians and parties.

Whilst a lot has been made of the foibles of youth and the dangers of old social media posts ruining candidate&#8217;s reputations, [the real danger][9] is in the policies of those candidates once they come to power.

Meanwhile, there&#8217;s been increased media attention on the practices of political parties themselves in their [microtargeting][10], [profiling][11] and [tracking][12] of potential voters.

Facebook had announced that it would increase measures to [stop foreign influence][13] during the election, but failed to implement transparency measures that are already available in the US. So the Guardian launched their own [database of political Facebook ads][14].

It&#8217;s no surprise that digital rights aren&#8217;t a core election issue &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to make these issues relatable to the everyday voter (despite our best efforts to do so). But the recent slew of legislation rammed through parliament is starting to have a negative impact, with a radical downturn in [public trust in government online services][15], and the predictable dip in [Australia&#8217;s ranking for startups][16] and online businesses.

As outlined by [Scott Ludlam in the Guardian][17], we still have a chance to correct this &#8211; by insisting that whichever party forms Government, they repeal the unnecessary and unwarrented powers afforded under the Assistance and Access Bill.

Once the dust has settled and we have a clear idea of the make-up of our Parliament, rest assured that we&#8217;ll be pushing for radical changes to the legislation that has so badly impacted your digital rights.

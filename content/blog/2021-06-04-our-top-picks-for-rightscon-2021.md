It's the most wonderful time of the year! No, not the holidays, it's RightsCon season!

[RightsCon][1] is the world's leading summit on human rights in the digital age, hosted by our friends at [Access Now][2]. It will take place 7-11 June and it will, once again, be entirely virtual.

But, with over 500 sessions across 20 program streams in 5 daysâ€¦ it's a lot. Decisions, decisions! Plus, if you're in Australia, things get tricky with timezones. The program can be daunting, so we've gone through and picked out our favourites, all tailored to a \*reasonable\* Australia-based sleep cycle.

**But first, we want to tell you about the session Digital Rights Watch is running!**

On Tuesday 8th of June at 2pm AEST / 12pm AWST, we're hosting our session on: **Rebalancing the Internet Economy: A closer look at Australia's News Media Bargaining Code. **<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

We won't spend too long recapping what happened in the bargaining code, rather we will be looking at what local internet economies look like on the global web and how rebalancing the local and global economies could help facilitate a more equitable system!

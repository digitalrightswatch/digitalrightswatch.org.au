It&#8217;s been another big year in the Australian digital rights movement.

Today we&#8217;re launching our **State of Digital Rights Report: a 2022 Retrospective**. In it, we reflect on the key developments in digital rights in Australia over the course of the year and look ahead to what we expect for 2023.

As 2022 draws to a close, we are seeing big shifts in the internet economy that create openings to fight for better alternatives to the business models of surveillance and tracking which have defined modern big-tech.

We will be pushing politicians and lawmakers to get privacy reform right, fighting the culture of surveillance, and facilitating important discussions and actions to pave the way for a better, fairer internet. [Read more about our plans here.][1]

We won't be able to build a better democracy without building a democratic internet. 2023 is going to be a big year for Digital Rights Watch, but we can't do this work without your support.

The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications has been asked to run a [public consultation over a new Online Safety Act][1] to improve Australia&#8217;s online safety regulatory framework.

The proposed reforms follow a 2018 review of online safety legislation which recommended the replacement of the existing framework with a single Online Safety Act.

[Digital Rights Watch provided our own submission to this process.][2]

Our lives are better when we all treat each other with respect and compassion. That's why it's so important the values that everyone holds dear – like fairness and equality – are properly protected.

But all too often, our political 'leaders' let us down. Together we can change this.

We need an **Australian Charter of Human Rights** so everyone's rights are properly protected and people have the power to hold governments to account.

A Charter of Human Rights is about putting the rights of people ahead of the interests of politicians and corporations. It's about holding governments to account and making sure they follow the rules that apply to them.

Together we can ensure everyone's rights are properly protected and that people have the power to hold governments to account.

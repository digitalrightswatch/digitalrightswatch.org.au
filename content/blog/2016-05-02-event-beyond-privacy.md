'Lawfulness' is routinely referred to by state agencies as the benchmark for appropriate surveillance. But how might the law, intended as a safeguard, actually be used to undermine a democratic system of checks and balances?

This panel explores how laws protect the privacy of Australians against mass surveillance. Is Australia's Privacy Act a meaningful safegaurd? What difference does a bill of rights make for protecting against surveillance related harms? How does Australia compare with countries that have a bill of rights, such as Canada or the US?

**AI companies are data-mining Australian books, songs, and artworks to build their models without consent, without compensation, and without accountability.**

Digitally-reproducing works without permission or payment infringes *section 31* of the Copyright Act. This is as true when using copyrighted material to train AI models as it would be for any other purpose.

Training an AI usually involves using crawlers to scrape material like novels, academic journals, or artwork; then using algorithms to train models that respond to user prompts. In general, there is no exemption for this use under copyright law; AI companies that work in this way rarely seek permission or pay to license works.

**At the moment Big Tech is pressuring our government to legalise industrialised copyright violation.**

**Join our campaign to protect Australian culture today.**

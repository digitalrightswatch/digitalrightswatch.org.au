This coming Thursday 27th October, we&#8217;ll be joining a panel discussion at the annual conference of the Australian Council for International Development in Melbourne.

**Unknowable Transparency: human rights in a digital world**

Our world has gone digital &#8211; something that makes our lives easier, quicker and more responsive. But with this comes a rights dilemma &#8211; are we making it easier for activists, campaigners, aid workers and humanitarians to be tracked, identified or targeted by hostile governments? Is the NGO world prepared to understand these risks, and what can we do to ensure we&#8217;re ready for this new frontier? Our panellists will have an active discussion of how surveillance, privacy, data security and transparency relate to activists, campaigners, aid workers and humanitarians in the international development sector.

Speakers: Archie Law, CEO of Action Aid Australia; Tim Norton, Save the Children/Digital Rights Watch; Emily Howie, Human Rights Law Centre; Steph Cousins, Amnesty International Australia; Paul Farrell, Guardian Australia.

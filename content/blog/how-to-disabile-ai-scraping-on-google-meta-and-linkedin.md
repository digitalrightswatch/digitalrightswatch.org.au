Major tech companies have been quietly updating their processes to include scraping personal information to train their AI models. 

## Google

Google has updated their policies and settings to allow scraping of data from emails and Drive documents. Follow the steps below to disable AI training on your data, but please note this will disable Gemini and so-called 'Smart' features like AI assisted email and docs content generation.

### Steps to stop Google training AI on your emails and documents:

* Go to your Gmail settings
* Click 'See all settings'
* In your general settings, scroll down to the bottom
* Smart features: Turn off 'smart features in Gmail, Chat, and Meet'
* Google Workspace smart features: Click ‘Manage Workspace smart feature settings’
* Toggle off: ‘Smart features in Google Workspace’ and ‘Smart features in other Google products

Digital Rights Watch provided a submission to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communication on the proposed _Online Safety Bill 2020._

While we welcome the objectives of the draft Bill to &#8220;improve and promote Australia&#8217;s online safety&#8221; and note that some of the powers in the Bill create critical pathways of redress for children and adults suffering bullying, abuse and non-consensual sharing of intimate images, we are concerned that several powers proposed in the Bill will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">undermine digital rights and exacerbate harm for vulnerable groups. </span>

You can read our [explainer on the Bill here][1].

#### A summary of our recommendations are:

  * Include a sunset clause.
  * Remove the adult cyber-abuse content scheme. ​
  * Establish a multi-stakeholder review board for activity covered by the Bill.
  * Require transparency reporting on complaints and take-downs.
  * Articulate a meaningful and timely appeals process.
  * Include an explicit assurance that ISPs and/or digital platforms will not be expected to weaken or undermine encryption in any way to comply with any parts of this Bill. ​

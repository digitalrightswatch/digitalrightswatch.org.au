Did you know that we send out a monthly roundup to our supporters? On the last Friday of each month we pull together our perspectives on the latest hot tech goss and digital rights issues, share links to resources and upcoming events and ways to take action. In our September round up we tackle TikTok Troubles, the Data Availability and Transparency bill (yes, we're reading the 104 page exposure draft so you don't have to), and recent documentary, The Social Dilemma. We usually try to keep people \*off\* lists, but our supporter list is one you want to be on. Head to our website (through our bio!) to sign up ?[Image Description: 3D text that reads: "TL;DR" in yellow, blue and white, on a green background.]#digitalrights #humanrights #privacy #dataprivacy #security #datasecurity #dataprotection #socialmedia #democracy #surveillance #thesocialdilemma #tiktok #auspol #auspolitics

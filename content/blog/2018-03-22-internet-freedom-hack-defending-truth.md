Digital Rights Watch is proud to support the [Internet Freedom Hack][1], happening this year in Melbourne and Brisbane between 20-22 April.

Internet Freedom Hack is a community event that brings technologists with a passion for digital rights together for a weekend to build things that advance the cause of internet freedom.

Internet freedom means a lot of things. We want an internet that makes us more connected, more ourselves, and more equal. But the internet of today can make us more isolated, more afraid to be ourselves, and more like the property of tech giants such as Google and Facebook.

Join us alongside developers, experience designers, visual designers, quality analysts, business analysts, puzzle solvers, ideas people, managers as we explore the causes of privacy, digital rights, transparency, and accountability.

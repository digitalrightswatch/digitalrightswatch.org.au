On 17 June 2025, Digital Rights Watch wrote to several politicians to congratulate them on their appointment and request clarity on their position regarding the promised privacy reforms. Specifically, we asked:

● What is your position on the remaining reforms to the Privacy Act 1988 agreed to, in principle or otherwise, in the previous government’s response to the Attorney General Department’s Privacy Act Review Report? \[iii] 

● If you support the implementation of the remaining reforms, when can the Australian public expect this to occur?

We informed each recipient that their response—or lack thereof—would be published. By publishing these responses, Digital Rights Watch aims to hold politicians accountable to their commitments and encourage timely implementation of the reforms.

Currently, [political parties](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/more-privacy-rights/political-parties-and-elections#:~:text=A%20registered%20political%20party%20is,of%20a%20local%20government%20authority.) and [over 92%](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/business-indicators/counts-australian-businesses-including-entries-and-exits/latest-release) of [Australian businesses are exempt](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-guidance-for-organisations-and-government-agencies/organisations/small-business) from the Privacy Act. Entities that are subject to the Act can often bypass obligations through “tick-a-box” consent processes. When breaches of the Australian Privacy Principles do occur, the OAIC's ability to adequately address them is undermined by their [underfunding](https://australiainstitute.org.au/post/underfunded-accountability-institutions/). These conditions, among others, leave Australians’ privacy exposed. It is therefore essential that the recommended reforms are implemented without delay.

## Ministerial responses to transparency request

#### **MP Julian Leeser**

*Member for Berowra*

*Leads Liberal Party engagement on privacy law reform*

"**Privacy protection remains an important priority for the Coalition.** We have consistently advocated for stronger privacy protections for Australians, including **increased penalties for serious data breaches and greater accountability from organisations handling personal data.**

The Coalition is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of our policies following the election. This includes examining our approach to privacy law reform and considering the outstanding recommendations from the Attorney General's Department Privacy Act Review Report.

While **I cannot provide specific timelines at this stage,** I can assure you that privacy reform will be part of our policy development process. We recognise the importance of protecting Australians' personal information in our increasingly digital world, and any reforms we support will be guided by the principles of strengthening privacy protections while ensuring practical implementation."

#### **Senator David Shoebridge**

*Senator for NSW*

*Digital Rights and IT Portfolio*

"I can confirm we **fully support the swift implementation of the remaining reforms identified in the Attorney General Department’s Privacy Act Review Report.** These changes are clearly needed and will work to protect individuals and communities from some of the more egregious impacts on their privacy. As you note in your correspondence, we have previously moved amendments to implement some of these changes including introduction of a fair and reasonable test, a clear definition of consent, and a modernised definition of personal information that reflects technological advancements. These changes are critically important.

**We believe these reforms are significantly overdue and would hope that new laws could be introduced to the Parliament when it returns in July 2025.** The Australian Greens are ready to work collaboratively to make these changes law.

It is worth noting that there are other significant issues within privacy protection in Australia that also need addressing including the ongoing underfunding of the OAIC that means our privacy regulator is not able to properly perform its role. This is also something the Australian Greens are committed on working to reform."

#### **MP Annika Wells**

*Member for Lilley*

*Minister for Communications*

**"The Albanese Government is prioritising the safety of Australians online.** As you will be aware, in February 2025, the Government tabled the report of the independent statutory review of the Online Safety Act 2021 (the review). The review made 67 recommendations to strengthen Australia’s online safety laws which **the Government is examining and will respond to in due course. "**

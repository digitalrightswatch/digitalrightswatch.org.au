Last week our Programme Director, Lucie Krahulcova, gave a talk at #pyconau on 'Technosolutionism and Human Rights.'As technologists we have a responsibility to consider how the decisions we make, the problems we try to solve (and the new ones we might create along the way!), and the tools we build have political impact. Choosing to 'opt-out' of being political in favour of just building cool interesting stuff is in itself a political decision! You can see Lucie's talk on the PyCon AU Youtube Channel [Image Description: a blue quote on a pink background that reads: "We need to consider how technology interacts with existing power structures. As soon as we touch technology it becomes political &#8211; Lucie Krahulcova."]#technology #humanrights #digitalrights #politics #auspol #auspolitics

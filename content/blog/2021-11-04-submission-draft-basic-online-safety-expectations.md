The _Online Safety Act 2021 _passed in June this year and comes into effect on 23 January 2022. Under Part 4 of the legislation, the Minister has the power to determine something called the **Basic Online Safety Expectations** (BOSE).

The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, and Communications has released an exposure draft of the _Draft Online Safety (Basic Online Safety Expectations) Determination 2021_, which is [open for submissions until 12 November 2021][1].

Digital Rights Watch teamed up with [Global Partners Digital][2] to make a submission, highlighting our shared concerns, as well as a series of recommendations on how the proposals could be revised to mitigate the risks posed to privacy, security, and freedom of expression online.

**Human rights must be at the centre of Australia's approach to tech policy**

Protecting, enhancing and upholding human rights is essential to ensuring Australia's technology policy is robust, fit for purpose, and meaningfully contributes to the improvement of individuals and community wellbeing both online and off.

Digital Rights Watch actively participates in public consultations regarding the development of legislation and policy in relation to technology and human rights. We have consistently contributed to the public debate regarding many of the inquiry's terms of reference, in particular in relation to age verification and the news media bargaining code.

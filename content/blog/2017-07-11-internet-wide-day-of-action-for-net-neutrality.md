**We need your help**

The Trump administration In the US wants to destroy net neutrality and give big cable companies control over what we see and do online. If they get their way, they'll allow widespread throttling, blocking, censorship, and extra fees.

[**On July 12th, the Internet will come together to stop them. Join us.**][1]

Net neutrality is the basic principle that protects our free speech on the Internet. &#8220;Title II&#8221; of the US Communications Act is what provides the legal foundation for net neutrality and prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T from slowing down and blocking websites, or charging apps and sites extra fees to reach an audience (which they then pass along to consumers.)

**So what exactly is net neutrality?**
The Internet has thrived precisely because of net neutrality. It&#8217;s what makes it so vibrant and innovativeâ€”a place for creativity, free expression, and exchange of ideas. Without net neutrality, the Internet will become more like Cable TV, where the content you see is what your provider puts in front of you.

**What&#8217;s happening on July 12th?**
Websites, Internet users, and online communities will come together to sound the alarm about this attack on net neutrality. From the SOPA blackout to the Internet Slowdown, we&#8217;ve shown time and time again that when the Internet comes together, we can stop censorship and corruption. Now, we have to do it again!

**OK I&#8217;m in. How?**
[Join the global online protests][1] against this attack on net neutrality. If you run your own website, download the code to join in. Share the video, graphic or other resources. Spread the word loud and far: we don&#8217;t stand by and let the principles of net neutrality be destroyed.

[**Join the movement**][1]

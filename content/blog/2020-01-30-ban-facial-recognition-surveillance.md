You are being tracked. On every street, in every park, as you sit at the train station or walk to work.

Surveillance using face recognition technologies is on the rise, all across Australia. It&#8217;s being used by local councils, corporations, government departments and telecommunication companies &#8211; all without you even noticing. And it&#8217;s time that we reign in.

**Help us to ban this unwarranted invasion &#8211; can you contribute to our crowdfund campaign to fight for your privacy?**

Corporations are arguing that facial recognition can improve productivity levels, whilst law enforcement and governments claim that it will help improve public safety.

The reality is that it is rapidly becoming an unwanted invasion into our everyday lives, and our elected representatives are turning a blind eye and allowing this to happen without controls or oversight.

**Please support our work to build a people-powered movement that pushes for a moratorium on the use of face recognition technologies.**

[Me and My Shadow][1] is a project from the Tactical Technical Collective that helps you explore and minimise your &#8216;digital shadows&#8217;: the information traces you leave behind when you use the internet and mobile phones. The project helps you control your data traces, see how you&#8217;re being tracked, and learn more about the data industry.

Last week at NetThing we absolutely loved the panel on censorship and expression (and there's no hiding how proud we are of DRW Campaigner, Sam, who worked behind the scenes to pull it together!).The four amazing speakers explored how algorithmic bias, content policing, community guidelines and legislation are part of how offline violence, stigma and discrimination are replicated in online spaces, and vice versa!ICYMI you can watch it back through the link in our bio! Lola Hunt, co-founder of @assembly.four &#8211; a social enterprise with the mission of empowering sex workers through technology, highlighted that online violence is not seperate from offline violence. She also explained how US laws like SESTA/FOSTA and EARNIT impact internet freedoms for us in Australia as well &#8211; for sex workers and beyond. [Image Description: a blue quote on a pink background that reads: "Online violence trickles into offline violence very quickly. &#8211; Lola Hunt"]#digitalrights #humanrights #censorship #SESTA #FOSTA #onlineviolence #EARNIT #socialmedia #algorithmicbias

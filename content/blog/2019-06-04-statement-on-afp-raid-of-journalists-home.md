&#8220;It&#8217;s incredibly worrying to see AFP officers carry out a raid on the home of a political journalist working to reveal an important public interest issue &#8211; a potential massive expansion of domestic capacity in Australian spy agencies.

We fear that the powers given to the AFP to seize and search Annika Smethurst&#8217;s digital footprint represent a considerable risk to bold Australians who choose to expose wrongdoing in the public services.

This is a gross abuse of national security powers &#8211; using them to reinforce a culture of secrecy and lack of accountability in our law enforcement apparatus.&#8221;

Quotes attributable to Tim Singleton Norton, Chair &#8211; Digital Right's Watch.

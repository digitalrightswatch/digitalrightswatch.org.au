### Thank you for taking action. Could you do one more thing to support our work?

Digital Rights Watch is a registered charity organisation and we appreciate any financial support you can offer, small or large, for our ongoing fight to protect Australians&#8217; digital rights.

[gravityform id=&#8221;7&#8243; title=&#8221;false&#8221; description=&#8221;true&#8221;]

Our volunteer board and staff offer their time and expertise without pay, working from their homes and outside of their regular jobs, because they are dedicated to championing digital rights. We want to make sure that every person in Australia has fair access to the internet and can do so safely, with dignity, and in an empowered manner.

Your generous support allows us to continue the work we&#8217;ve been doing for years, since Digital Rights Watch&#8217;s founding in 2016. Each donation helps us to further our advocacy efforts &#8211; such as running programs to educate people about their digital rights, facilitating public events with human rights defenders, and launching national awareness campaigns.

_We will never share your contact or financial details with anyone else. [Read our full Privacy Policy here.][1]_

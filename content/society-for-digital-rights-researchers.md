The Society for Digital Rights Researchers (SocDRR) is an initiative of Digital Rights Watch (DRW), a not-for-profit organisation focused on ensuring a vibrant, dignified and equal digital future for all Australians. The Society aims to improve the engagement of researchers in protecting and promoting digital rights for all.

### **Become a Member**

Membership will be open to researchers who are contributing to a critical understanding of the impact of digital transformation in our lives and the world around us, now and into the future.


### **Member Contributions and Benefits**

By joining the Society, members will contribute to sustaining the important work that DRW does. Members may also be also called upon to guide DRW's work and provide expert advice on policy responses, be given opportunities to engage the public by participating on panels at DRW events and being offered media interviews.

All members will receive the Society's e-newsletter that curates relevant information on digital rights research, and will qualify for discounted rates to DRW events, including our proposed Digital Rights Summit that is planned for the third quarter in 2020.

### **Join Now**

We want to ensure that membership to the Society is accessible to all researchers and the contribution you make will be up to you. We rely on member donations to fund our staff and outreach activities, and we hope that you will support our ongoing work to promote human rights in the digital age.

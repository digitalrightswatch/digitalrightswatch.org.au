We&#8217;re pretty into our stickers, and we&#8217;ve already [got a few that are available for our supporters][1]. These are great ways for people to show their passion for digital rights, by plastering their digital devices, cars and guitar cases.

But we&#8217;re looking for some new designs, to refresh our collection and inspire a whole new generation of digital rights activists!

### So show us your design skills!

You might want to come up with some new, hilariously witty slogans for our bumper stickers, or design a new mascot, or just play around with some amazingly avant-garde artwork!

We&#8217;ll be running this competition throughout 2019, with a winner announced later in the year. The ultimate prize? A LOT of your sticker designs arriving in the post, as well as some cool technology toys to play with.

For the detailed designers, you can [download our logo here][2], and our signature colour is [yellow (#ffed10)][3]. But we also welcome any and all entries &#8211; even those photographs of sketches on the back of a napkin.

\[This is an archive of our Australian Cities for Digital Rights campaign. Thank you to everyone who participated.]

**There's nothing smart about eroding our rights.**

Australians should be able to live their lives without being constantly watched, monitored and tracked. If we want our cities to be truly 'smart,' they need to uphold the freedoms of the people who inhabit them.

We are calling on Australian local government authorities to incorporate human rights principles into their digital platforms and initiatives. Because if a city doesn't uphold privacy, freedom of expression and democracy―it's just not that smart.

### Smarter cities

Technology is inseparable from our everyday lives.

A 'smart city' uses technology such as sensors, Internet of Things devices and CCTV cameras to generate and collect data, with the promise of increased efficiency, livability, and convenience.

Sometimes this is true. A bin that automatically composts itself, or innovative ways to manage waste and improve energy efficiency to minimise environmental impact―that's smart.

But it's not all smart.

Mismanagement and misuse of personal information, poor data security protections resulting in regular data breaches that puts people at risk―not smart.

Rapid expansion of surveillance technology in public spaces that erodes the privacy rights of everyday people doing nothing more than living their lives―the opposite of smart.

'Intelligence-driven' policing that uses AI-fueled crime prediction software and racially biased facial recognition technology―downright dangerous.

Technology is developing far more rapidly than we could have predicted just a few decades ago. Increases in computer power; access to more sophisticated surveillance systems; data-matching and linked databases; and a rise in the use of AI and automated systems have seen many governments expanding their 'public safety' programs and turning to the concept of developing 'smart cities'.

But it's the wrong kind of smart.

### The wrong kind of smart

We want to see technology being used to enhance and protect human rights.

Instead, too often these 'smart' data-centric projects focus on constant generation, collection and processing of data. But more data does not always mean more smart. Rather, it increases security risk, creates an imbalance of power between people and government, and erodes our right to privacy.

As we place sensors and CCTV cameras all over our streets, buildings and public spaces, we are building a world in which we are constantly subject to surveillance. In Australia, we are already starting to see these technologies roll out in several cities, such as Perth, Brisbane and Darwin.

There is no empirical evidence that supports the assertion that city-wide surveillance is effective at preventing serious crime and terrorism either domestically or internationally. In fact, if anything, these approaches almost always erode rights and diminish freedoms.

At Digital Rights Watch, we're not against technology. We think technology can and should be used to make our lives better and protect the environment. But a truly smart city must also protect and enhance human rights and freedoms.

### Cities for Digital Rights Initiative

Local governments have a huge opportunity to lead the way in creating truly smart cities. Cities for digital rights!

In 2018, the Cities for Digital Rights initiative was launched by Barcelona, Amsterdam and New York City with the support of the United Nations Human Settlements Program, with an aim to protect, promote and monitor residents' and visitors' digital rights.

Many more local government authorities around the world have since adopted this declaration, including the City of Sydney, with others such as the City of San Francisco recently moving to ban all use of facial recognition software.

Let's create truly smart Australian cities that stand up for our digital rights!

#### Ask your local council to stand up for your digital rights

Dear Mayor, Councillors and Council staff,

I write to express my growing concern about the rapid expansion of surveillance technology in public spaces; often those directly managed by local government authorities; and to ask for our city to sign up to the Cities for Digital Rights initiative.

The internet has become inseparable from our daily lives. Yet, every day, there are new cases of digital rights abuse, misuse and misinformation and concentration of power around the world.

Technology is developing far more rapidly than we could have predicted just a few decades ago. Increases in computer power, access to more sophisticated surveillance systems, data-matching and linked databases and a rise in the use of AI and automated systems have seen many governments expanding their 'public safety' programs and turning to the concept of developing 'smart cities'.

But it's the wrong kind of smart.

Far from taking advantage of technological leaps to enhance and protect rights, these data-centric projects focus on the constant generation, collection and processing of data, often with a cost for our right to privacy.

Indeed, as we place sensors and CCTV cameras all over our streets, buildings and public spaces, we are building a world in which we are constantly subject to surveillance. Here in Australia we are already starting to see these technologies roll out in several cities already, such as Perth, Brisbane and Darwin.

There is no empirical evidence that supports the assertion that blanket surveillance is effective at preventing serious crime and terrorism either domestically or internationally. In fact, if anything, these approaches almost always erode rights and diminish freedoms.

It is extremely worrying to watch as we are sleep-walking into a world where our cities are becoming vulnerable and, ultimately, so are we as individuals &#8211; to all types of security threats including breaches, leaks and hacking as well.

The issue of security is often ignored or not prioritised in the design, implementation and maintenance of such 'smart' initiatives. We must ensure that the current models of smart cities are indeed smart for all who inhabit them, with equal weight given to every citizen.

Current initiatives often fail to take into consideration issues of poverty, access to technology, access for the less-abled and, more generally, the issue of gender and how to ensure cities are smart for all genders.

By failing to do so, these supposedly 'smart cities' are not only failing to address issues they promise to address such as discrimination, exclusion, poor service delivery and safety, but they are actually heightening them.

However, there are positive interventions that local government representatives can do to protect residents against this rising trend.

In 2018, the Cities for Digital Rights initiative was launched by the three major cities of Barcelona, Amsterdam and New York City with the support of the United Nations Human Settlements Program, with an aim to protect, promote and monitor residents' and visitors' digital rights.

Many more local government authorities around the world have since adopted this declaration, including the City of Sydney, with others such as the City of San Francisco recently moving to ban all use of facial recognition software.

Often our local government authorities are the closest democratic institutions to the people, and are best placed to take on the duty of eliminating impediments to harnessing technological opportunities that improve the lives of our constituents, and to providing trustworthy and secure digital services and infrastructures that support communities.

A truly smart city would be one that signs up to the Cities for Digital Rights initiative: citiesfordigitalrights.org

You can see more about what local governments can do at https://digitalrightswatch.org.au/cities/city-councillors-for-digital-rights/ or contact Digital Rights Watch at info@digitalrightswatch.org.au

It is only through the incorporation of human rights principles such as privacy, freedom of expression, and democracy into digital platforms; starting with locally-controlled digital infrastructures and services; that we will have truly 'smart' cities that are designed for the people.

I ask you to please add our City to the growing list of those already signed up to the Cities for Digital Rights initiative or progress similar measures throughout our City.

I look forward to hearing from you.

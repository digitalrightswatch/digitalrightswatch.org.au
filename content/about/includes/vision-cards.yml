  ## Our Vision {class="display-5 text-center mx-auto underlined-header testing123"}
  Our vision is for a digital world where all humanity can thrive, and where diversity and creativity flourishes.
  To ensure this, our digital world must be underpinned by equality, freedom and established human rights principles. Its evolution and future must be guided and driven by the interests of all people and the environments we live in.

  Digital Rights Watch exists to defend and promote this vision â€“ to ensure fairness, freedoms and fundamental rights for all people who engage in the digital world.


  **Our mission is to ensure that Australians are equipped, empowered and enabled to uphold their digital rights. We believe that digital rights are human rights which see their expression online.**

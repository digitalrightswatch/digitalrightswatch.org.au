## Our guiding principles {class="display-5 text-center mx-auto underlined-header"}

### Accountable
We are trustworthy, honest and have integrity. Our funding sources will be public domain and we will be transparent on how our financial expenditure and work contributes to our purpose.

### Solidarity
Our work will be driven by the interests of the public, and we will work in partnership with civil society and grassroots initiatives that share our vision.

### Collaboration
We recognise there are other organisations working in the space of defending and promoting digital rights, and we will strive to work in partnership, in a non-competitive way with others.

### Lean approach
We are committed to implementing projects and activities in an efficient and cost-effective way, and incorporating lessons learned to improve our impact.

### Innovation
We will aim to push boundaries and use tactics and strategies that are 'outside-the-box'. We will work with artists and the creative community to help drive positive change.

### Global to local
We recognise that the digital world is borderless and we will work with allies from around the world to contribute to a global digital rights movement and maximise the local impact of our work.

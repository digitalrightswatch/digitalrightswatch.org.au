The first year of operations for Digital Rights Watch hasn't come without challenges. We have a Government who continue to implement a national warrantless mass surveillance program, the huge privacy failure of the national Census and ongoing issues around the privacy of Australian citizens online.

We have nonetheless made huge ground in establishing both the need and effectiveness of a digital rights advocacy organisation.

Digital Rights Watch's mission is to ensure that Australian citizens are equipped, empowered and enabled to uphold their digital rights. We educate, campaign, lobby and advocate for a digital environment where individuals have the power to maintain their human rights.

In the past year, we've increased our media profile and written substantive submissions to several key inquiries. We've engaged with Government, secured partnerships with likeminded organisations, spoken at conferences and joined global campaigns and movements.

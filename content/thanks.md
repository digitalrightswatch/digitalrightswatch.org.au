### Thanks for recommending us to your friend!

We are a charity organisation made up of dedicated volunteers doing this work in addition to our regular jobs, academic commitments and parenting duties, and we deeply appreciate you supporting us in this way.

It&#8217;s through the actions of passionate individuals like you that we&#8217;ll grow our movement, build our capacity and make the necessary change to ensure Australian&#8217;s digital rights are upheld.

Hey, you could also [tweet][1] and [post on Facebook][2] about us. When it comes to human rights, we&#8217;re all in this together.

## Thank you!
